Description: The purpose of this project is to design, simulate, implement, and verify a Simple RISC Computer (Mini SRC) consisting of a simple RISC processor, memory, and I/O, using Intel Quartus II design software, ModelSim simulation software and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware. To be implemented on the Cyclone III chip (EP3C16F484) of the DE0 evaluation board or on the Cyclone V chip (5CEBA4F23C7) of the DE0-CV evaluation board.
